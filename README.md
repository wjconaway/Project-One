Expense Reimbursement System (ERS)

The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees for 
expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can login and submit requests 
for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and 
view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance managers 
are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.
